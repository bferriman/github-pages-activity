    <h1>Siamese Cats!</h1>
    <p>Siamese cats are the greatest.  First of all, they look awesome.  Their coats will be one of several colors, like seal point, or chocolate point.  All of them have darker tails, paws, faces, etc., and lighter bodies.</p>
    <p>Siamese behavior differs from other cats in several ways.  In some ways, they behave more like dogs, having a tendency to follow their owners around the house.  They are also more vocal than most other breeds, meowing frequently.</p>
